# Hello!

This is my personal website, which I made in a weekend to get some experience using Jekyll, Bootstrap, and the Atom text editor.
During my front-end bootcamp, I bolted on a few things to satisfy some lab requirements, and I plan to refactor some of this as soon as I get some free time.

## What I Learned
+ some experience using the Liquid templating system, which will come in handy if I ever have a Shopify project
+ Gulp, Sass, and Node.js

## What's Working
+ I'm happy with the overall design and vibe, which I made up
+ Github integration and local building/preview with Jekyll

## What Needs Work
+ Refactoring -- lots of overlap between Jekyll and the Gulp workflow I set up during my bootcamp lab (e.g., /_sass and /Sass)
+ Tags and categories not yet functional
+ More frequent blogging :)
