After presenting [my final project](http://www.cookloveconnect.com) to a packed house on Friday, I'm officially a graduate of the Grand Circus Front-End Coding Bootcamp. It feels great, and it was definitely one of the best experiences I've ever had. I'll miss the people in my cohort, our instructors, and the super-friendly staff of Grand Circus, but I'm excited to see where everyone lands and how we continue to grow as developers.

But the Monday after is rough, right? I'm eager to continue learning and building new things, but looking at my Github and portfolio there seems to be a lot of unfinished business. Some of this stuff is barely styled, is not responsive. I am now capable of doing much better work than I pushed just a few weeks ago. I've been learning to code publicly &ndash; what's the next step?

### Push Now, Refactor Later

During these past eight weeks, I tried to learn something new and push evidence of that work to Github every day. This was a personal challenge, because historically I have tried to avoid showing off drafts at all costs. I always wanted to be judged on my final product, not my process, so nobody had to see the false starts and dead ends necessary to making something I was proud of. But I sensed that development was going to be different.

I made commits on 50 of those days, and I know exactly what I was doing the other four (working through MongoDB tutorials, presenting my final project at Demo Day). That feels good. I know that I probably pushed too often or not enough at times, and I wish I had researched branching before our last week of instruction. But I am confident that things are getting better, and that's a trend I hope is evident to people who are used to looking at a typical junior developer Github account.

### This is Just the Beginning

Programming is hard. I didn't expect to come out of bootcamp with the wisdom, speed, and skills of a senior developer. But I did expect to come out of this with a better sense of how I could continue to improve as a developer, and I definitely feel scrappier and more resourceful than I did in June. That is a huge win.

I am also happy to report that bootcamp has confirmed what I suspected was the case: great programmers are not born, they are made. This is probably true of every kind of skill, at least if people like [Anders Ericcson](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise/dp/0544456238/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471888823&sr=8-1&keywords=peak) are right. It took Ira Glass [eight years](http://transom.org/2004/ira-glass/#manifesto) to reach a level of compentence where he could write and structure his own stories. Worse, that whole time he probably knew he could be better. Here's Glass on [the gap between taste and ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI23U7U2aUY):

<blockquote>For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. *But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you.* A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.</blockquote>

Emphasis mine. I'm glad I went to bootcamp at Grand Circus. I came out of this with a solid foundation and feel capable of learning new frameworks, languages, and approaches to web development that seemed out of reach just a few short months ago. That gap is only going to narrow, and I'm ready to get started.
