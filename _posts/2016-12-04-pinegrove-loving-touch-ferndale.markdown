Pinegrove made my favorite record of 2016, and I got to see them in my neighborhood tonight. I hate to say it, but I didn't even stick around for the headliner. I didn't think this could be topped, and I can't wait to see them again when they head back out on tour.

Here's the setlist:

+ Recycling
+ Cadmium
+ Patterson and Leo
+ Size of the Moon
+ Angelina
+ Aphasia
+ Old Friends
+ Visiting
+ New Friends
