Back in May of 2014, I supported [a project on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bearded/what-comes-next-is-the-future) called *What Comes Next Is the Future: A Documentary About the Web*. I'm so glad I did. In just one hour, creator Matt Griffin presents a solid overview of how the web has been shaped since its inception, as told by the people responsible for shaping it.

### A Brief History of the Web

If you make things for the web, chances are [you've read a bit](https://html5forwebdesigners.com/history/) about it's history. Based on what I knew coming in, I felt like most of the highlights are represented beginning with Tim Berners-Lee and the advent of the web. This is a story of a system that is meant to be open and simple and how it has changed in response to people hacking together new ways of using that system.

Beginning with the "no layout layout" in the Mosaic-era Internet, we see web developers starting to use elements in ways they weren't designed to be used. Having just completed a coding bootcamp, our instructors were adamant that we must **never use tables for layout**, so somebody out there must still be doing it. We know there are now better tools for that job, but watching this documentary I really admired the workarounds people developed to get around the constraints they had with a pretty limited toolset. So table-based layout, and later floats and Flash, was a marker of someone who was resourceful and scrappy.

There were several "this changes everything" moments: the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/), the introduction of the iPhone ([RIP Flash](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/)), and, of course, [Responsive Web Design](https://responsivewebdesign.com/). I enjoyed hearing not only from the people who developed these technologies (hey, the inventors of JavaScript and jQuery!), but also the people whose work had to fundamentally change in response to them. So we hear from the Web Standards Project, browser makers, web developers, instructors, and other people who contribute to the world wide web. Based on this mix, I think this documentary will play well to people with varying degrees of experience building things for the web.

### Gatekeeping and the Open Web

I was pleased to see the director included time to discuss the web as a democratic, open system. One moment that stands out to me is during a discussion of how mobile apps (something specific to a platform like iOS or Android) differ from web apps. Here's Alex Russell, Software Engineer at Google:

> It's the ability to create an experience and hand it to somebody else without asking anybody for permission, without going through creating, minting, signing, and pushing a binary to somebody else. It's the ability to start publishing without gatekeepers. And maybe nobody pays attention, and that's OK. But not being able to say it in the first place? That's a fundamentally different kind of constraint. . . . The web is unique in that it hasn't had that kind of constraint. I think it is the most democratizing system of our generation.

That's what still remains the most exciting part about the web for me. Sure, I am routinely blown away by some of the technological advances I've seen (most recently, web-based AR and music creation tools). It is astounding what one person can accomplish with a set of tools that are becoming increasingly commonplace and affordable.

If you're a person who makes things for the web, this is absolutely worth an hour of your time. I learned about new things to follow up on, like the [extensible web manifesto](https://github.com/extensibleweb/manifesto). Check out [the documentary website](http://www.futureisnext.com/) if you're interested in attending an upcoming screening or hosting one yourself.
