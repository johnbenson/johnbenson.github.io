I'm John Benson, a web developer and tech writer in Metro Detroit.

I help people make sense of things through text, speech, and code. I'm happiest when I am making complex, technical information accessible to a general audience - especially on the web.

Before relocating to Michigan in June 2016, I managed projects and business development for a web agency, maintained client portfolios for a boutique wealth management firm, and taught writing at a state university.
